REPORT end>>

	The starship LongShot sat in orbit about the planet Yannis, carefully 
docked with the space station HighCanyon.  The ship sat on one side of the 
giant cylinder's curved wall, her docking tube extended a mere 20 feet to 
close the distance between the vessel and the station.  Keeping clamps and 
cables snaked through the cold blackness of space, holding the LongShot and 
preventing her from moving out of position. 
	 They were currently on the dark side of orbit and sunrise wasn't for 
another 10 minutes.  The red and green stationkeeping lights that ran along 
HighCanyon's walls pulsed and strobed in the darkness as beacons for 
approaching ships.  The foil-covered tubes and cables that provided fuel and 
power shimmered faintly from the lights coming from the hundreds of 
windows along the station's walls.  Here and there, other ships could be seen, 
similarly docked.
	But the docking tube holding the LongShot secure seemed different 
than the others tonight.  For some reason, it seemed to be moving - rocking 
back and forth over and over and over...
***

	Alkit raced out of his room before the door had even had a chance to 
open completely.  Struggling to pull on his shirt and not crash headfirst into 
something at the same time he felt his way along the wall as the ship's claxon 
rang out the General Warning alarm.
	He'd just gotten his muzzle through the neckline and was able to see 
again, when Triva practically bowled him over running past him in the 
narrow corridor.
	"Oof!" he grunted, clutching the wall.  "Triva, watch where you are 
going!  And what's with the alarm?"
	"I'll give you two guesses Alkit!" she cried after him, rounding the 
curve in the hall.  She was racing toward the docking hatch.
	"Oh, drahn," Alkit fumed as he rushed off after his wolven mate.  
"Not again!"
	He had gone about 50 feet more when he reached Triva at the 
hatchway to the docking tube.  He clutched the metal clasps around the open 
pressure bulkhead, and looked out into the connection between the ship and 
the station.
	He saw Tess and Brand, playing a game of tag in the null-gee 
environment of the docking raceway!
	"Tess!" Alkit shouted.  "Brand!  What have we told you about playing 
in the docking area?"
	Brand, surprised, spun to look at his father.  But he misjudged his 
rotational change and smashed headfirst into the wall with his head.  The thin 
accordianed material flexed and bowed under the shock once again.  
	Tess was older and a bit more experienced at this game.  So she just 
grasped two of the nearest handholds to her, and anchored herself in place.  
She was upside down compared to Alkit and Triva.
	"You told us not to play in the docking tube because we get in the way 
of traffic," she meekly answered.  "But there's no traffic right now, so we 
aren't in the way."
	"Your father and I told you not to play in the tube, period!" Triva 
angrily spat.  "You and Brand get back on board the ship, this instant!"
	"Aw, Ma..." Brand whined as he managed to get hold of a nearby grip 
and regain control of his orientation.
	"Don't talk back to your mother," Alkit said firmly.  "Both of you, 
back to your rooms."
	"We weren't hurting anything." Brand sulked as he pulled himself 
hand over hand back toward his angry parents.  Tess swatted at him with her 
tail.
	"Brand, would you shut up?  Your gonna get us in trouble."
	"Mom!  Make Tess get her tail out of my face!"
	"Move it!" Triva fumed, grabbing for Tess as she came into reach and 
swinging her to land feet first in the ship's gravity field.  "We've told you not 
to play in the docking tube like that.  It's dangerous!"
	"That's right," Alkit agreed, holding out a vulpine hand for Brand to 
grasp.  "The raceway isn't as strong as the rest of the ship.  It can't handle 
your bouncing back and forth on the walls.  They'll break.  And when they 
break, you two will go flying out into space in an instant."
	Brand reached out and gripped his father's hand.
	"I'm sorry dad.  We didn't mean..."
	"I know son, I know." Alkit sighed as he pulled Brand inside and 
likewise swung the young wolf to stand erect.  "I know it's fun to play in 
zero gravity.  But you can't play in the docking tube.  Ever.  I don't want 
you, either of you, to go into it again unless your mother or I or one of the 
rest of the crew are with you.  Understood?"
	Both Tess and Brand stared at their feet and nodded their acceptance.
	"Good," Triva sharply said as she gripped them both by their ears.  
"Now, march!  Back to your rooms."  She began to walk with the two 
youthful wolves down the curved hallway of the ship.  
	She only managed a few steps before Shanus ran up to them.  She 
appeared disheveled and her unzipped orange jumpsuit looked like she'd 
slept in it.
	"Alkit!  Triva!  The station-master just sent a message on the comm 
system.  He demands to know what is wrong with our docking mechanism!"
	Alkit turned to the wall, and pressed a few buttons on the small black 
panel inset into the grey metal.  A second later, the ship's klaxon ceased, and 
the hallway was once more quiet.  He turned to face the panda with a pained 
look.
	"Nothing is wrong that a good spanking won't fix, Shanus."
	"Station-master Rannis said he was coming right over."
	Triva rolled her eyes and growled in exasperation.  "Oh.  Terrific.  As 
if things weren't bad enough."
	"Yeah, I know," Alkit sighed.  "And Shanus?  If we are expecting 
visitors, you might want to at least zip up."
	Shanus looked down at her chest, cursed softly, and turned to the wall 
away from everyone.
	"Sorry people.  I... was busy when the alarm went off and took my 
station at the bridge."
	Triva chuckled, moving her hands from the kids ears and onto their 
shoulders.
	"Well, the cubs are sorry for disturbing your rest."  She then looked 
down on them with a serious gleam in her eye and spoke to them in that 
dreaded mother's tone that all children fear.  "Aren't you?"
	Tess and Brand both nodded rapidly in response.
	Shanus finished fixing her zipper, then turned around to face the group 
once more.
	"It's all right, Triva.  No harm done..."  She then glared at the two 
young wolves and added, "this time."
	"It had better be the last time, if a certain pair of pups knows what's 
good for them."
	"Shanus, do you think you can take Tess and Brand back to their 
rooms as you head back to yours?" Alkit asked.
	"Oh?  So I'm on rapscalian duty now?"
	Triva chuckled and prodded her children to go with Shanus, who was 
already holding out her hands to the two young cubs.  The pair sullenly 
walked over to Shanus, and she put a hand behind their heads.
	"No, Shanus.  But Alkit and I need to wait here for the station 
manager.  Just make sure they get to their room as you walk by it.  Then you 
and Lancelot can get back to...to..." Triva stopped, slightly embarrassed.  
	Alkit came to her rescue a few seconds later.  "I believe you and 
Lancelot were discussing some of the finer points of poetry?"
	"Yeah, that's it Shanus.  You two can go back to your poetry reading."
	"Uh huh," Shanus humorously called behind her.  "I'll be sure to tell 
Lancelot that that's what we're doing.  He should get a kick out of that."
	"Probably," Triva said, getting over her embarrassment.
	"Only this time, try not to read so loud!" Alkit called after her as she 
and the cubs walked down the curved hall and out of sight.  "That, or turn 
some music on!"
	"Oh, please." Triva winced.  "Anything but that music of hers."  Alkit 
cocked an eyebrow at his pretty mate.  
	"You don't care for her tastes in bands?" he asked her.
	"I don't care for her tastes in tonal structure," she replied.  "I thought 
only Avians listened to that microtonal stuff.  I mean, 32 notes per octave?  
Don't you agree that's a bit extreme?"
	Alkit smiled.  "I imagine the musical keyboard must be dozens of feet 
long.  But taste is a matter of opinion."
	"Well, some of their so-called chords hurt my ears and there's no 
opinion about that."
	"They don't hurt my hearing any."
	"It's a wolf thing."
	"Excuse me?" a voice suddenly called out from the docking tube.  
Alkit, and Triva turned about to see who had boarded without their 
knowledge or permission.
	Standing there, just coming into the gravity field, was a tall, red-furred 
vixen.  She was dressed in a simple yet elegant tan jacket with a skirt and 
white shirt underneath.  She glided effortlessly from the zero gravity area to 
land gently on her feet, clad in luxurious and expensive-looking shoes.  Her 
red, bushy tail was tipped solid white and fell flat against her legs as null-gee 
gave way to forces generated by the gravity plates of the ship.  
	She was carrying a computerpad under her right arm, and Alkit 
noticed the hyperlink antenna on the back of the unit.  That surprised him.  
Such gear was very expensive and only wealthy executives who had to be in 
constant contact at all times could afford them.  That, or station managers 
who quite literally needed to have the universe at their fingertips.
	She saw Alkit looking at her and rewarded him with a smile.
	"Ah!  Captain Alkit.  Yes, this is the LongShot all right.  Permission to 
come aboard?"
	"Granted," Alkit said extending his hand politely to help her get 
through the bulkhead doorway.  "Welcome aboard.  And I hope you won't 
fine us for the incident with the docking tube."
	She looked at Alkit puzzedly for a moment, flicking an ear.
	"Why in the Void would I fine you?" she asked.
	Alkit and Triva looked at each other for a few seconds before turning 
their gazes back to their vulpine visitor.
	"Ah!" the vixen exclaimed, her eyes opening wide.  "I get it!  You 
think I'm from the station, and that I am coming here to yell at you about 
your young ones misbehaving."  
	"You mean you're not from the station?" Alkit asked.
	"No," she answered, and began to confidently pry her way between the 
fox and wolf, ignoring the outstretched hand and entering the hallway of the 
ship.  "I don't have anything to do with HighCanyon.  I'm from the Spacer's 
Guild."
	"The Guild?" Alkit and Triva both said in surprise.  It had been a long 
time since they had had a representative of the guild on board their ship.
	The vixen nodded and kept walking.  "That's right.  I'm from the 
office of psychological fitness.  I'm going to be hitching a ride with you back 
to Vulcape and conducting a psychiatric evaluation on someone once we get 
there."
	Alkit scowled and jogged to catch up with her. Triva was following 
close behind him.
	"It is customary for the guild to ask before dead-heading someone 
aboard a private ship," he pointed out with just a touch of annoyance. 
	She turned about instantly, and withdrew some papers from some 
unseen pocket.  She handed them to Alkit with little fanfare.
	"This should take care of any and all objections, Captain Alkit," she 
said assuredly.  "I believe you will find everything to be in order.  As for 
accommodations, I can room just about anyplace you care to put me."  	
	Alkit reached out, took the proffered papers, and began leafing through 
them, one page at a time.  He was still pouring over the documents, clearly 
emblazoned with the triple star seal of the spacer's guild, when the vixen 
leaned forward toward him.
	"I'll bet you have plenty of space in your quarters Alkit," she crooned.  
"That is, if you don't mind sharing your bed with me." She finished her 
sentence with a soft, inviting murr.
	Alkit's head shot up, clearly surprised at the offer.  
	Triva, showing remarkable self-control under the circumstances, only 
bared her teeth a little bit.  "Excuse me," she growled,  "but in case you 
didn't realize it, Alkit here is taken."
	"Indeed he is!"  The vixen laughed and stuck her hand out, offering to 
shake with Triva.  "Permit me to introduce myself.  I am Lisza Cyrelus."  
	Alkit's jaw dropped when he heard her mention her name.  He could 
only stand there dumbfounded as Triva cautiously accepted her outstretched 
hand and shook.  Her wolfen eyes were locked on the vixen's and never 
wavered.
	"Hello.  I'm Triva.  I'm Co-Captain of this ship, and Alkit's..."
	"Mate," Lisza interrupted.  "Yes, yes I know.  Well, I happen to be his 
wife."
